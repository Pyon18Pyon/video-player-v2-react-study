# video-player-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [video-player-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/video-player-v1-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This is a custom vide player. We can play and pause if we hover towards the bottom. It has a mute button, and we can also drag the volume to different levels. It also has a progress bar and if we click anywhere it jumps around in the video.

## Key features

- Has a functionality to track the current time of the video as well as the total duration.
- Ability to rewind and fast forward. 
- Ability to change the playback speed.
- Ability to toggle full screen with the screen icon.
- Mobile responsive.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
